## WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?
I’m from Lodi, California (the one in that CCR song,) which is in the Central Valley, between Stockton and Sacramento. I had fantastic math teachers in high school, and a ton of support from family, which ultimately led me to Cal as a math major.

## HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?
Until my first year at Cal, computers were magic. CS10, which I took in the Spring of 2015, was my first programming experience. I have since taken 61A/B and have played around with some personal projects in Python and Java. I’m thus a big believer in the efficacy of CS10 as an intro to CS.

## WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?
I started practicing Judo in Stockton, and continue to play here at Cal. I enjoy reading and listening to music. 

## WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS & SKILLS?
I have played the piano for 16 years or so, although not as much recently.

## HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?
I was fortunate enough to travel to the UK this Summer, and spent some time traveling around Scotland on my own.

## WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?
I am taking Math 153, 128A, and 126, as well as CS 170 this semester. As well as being a TA for CS10, I run an SLC study group for Math 55. Finally, I spend quite a bit of time on the mat at the RSF.
