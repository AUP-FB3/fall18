## WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?

I grew up in Chandigarh, a beautiful city right in the foothills of the Himalayas in India. I did my A Levels from Singapore and applied to Cal hoping to do mathematics and/or public health!

## HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?

I had very little experience in programming before coming to Cal. CS10 was my first proper programming course, and enough to convince me to pursue CS. I have programmed in Snap!, Python and Java. I love python the most.


## WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?

I love dancing; I trained to be a professional for a good number of years, both Indian and Western styles.

## WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS & SKILLS?

Dance, particularly hip-hop and salsa; I can imitate characters from some movies quite well (I think!); I am also a trained debater and adjudicator in the WSDC format.

## WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?

CS61C, CS188, UGBA103 and CS10.
