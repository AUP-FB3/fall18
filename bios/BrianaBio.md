## WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?

I grew up in Rowland Heights, California—a suburb on the edge of Los Angeles and Orange County. I went to an all-girls’ Catholic private school in Alhambra (fun fact: my graduating class was only 65 people). During the summer after my freshman year in HS, I went to a medical conference in Berkeley where I stayed for 11 days. I fell in love with the campus and environment during that experience. Every summer after, I came up to visit the campus and family. Fortunately, I was able to get into my dream school and now I’m here!

## HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?

The majority of my coding experience has been through CS10 and CS61A so Snap! and Python. I’ve also worked with Java, HTML, and LabVIEW in high school.

## WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?

I’m a pretty big couch potato so watching YouTube or reality TV shows while snacking is my biggest hobby. I also like playing poker and Pump It Up!, which is basically DDR but with 5 panels.

## WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS & SKILLS?

Does being able to finish a whole bag of Hot Cheetos in one sitting count?

## HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?

One of my fondest memories was leading my high school robotics team. During my senior year, we were able to reach the semi-finals of the regional competition, which was a record for my 11-year old robotics team. We were also able to go to the National Championship in St. Louis, which was something many of us never imagined we could do. To me, it was an amazing thing because we were an all-girls’ team that was often looked down upon and underestimated. Leading a group of amazing women was definitely an honor and one of the most remarkable things I’ve done so far.

I also met Drake Bell at Disneyland once.

## WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?

Bio 1A/L and Physics 8B. I’m also doing research with the Gopnik Cognitive Development Lab and on staff for Berkeley Engineers and Mentors (BEAM).
