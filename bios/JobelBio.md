## WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?

I am a local kid -- I grew up moving around various places throughout
the East Bay (Hercules, Vallejo, San Pablo, Richmond, and back to
Hercules). I spent many weekends in the shadow of the university
visiting my grandmother at work at Alta Bates Medical Center a few
blocks away from the school. When I got bored I would walk down
Telegraph Ave. and spend my afternoon at Amoeba and Rasputin's, looking
for used '90s rock and indie CDs. I didn't plan to go to Berkeley in high
school; it was too close to home, but it ended up being my choice.


## HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?

I began with Snap! (I had no programming experience throughout all of
grade school). Since then, I learned Python, Scheme, Java, C, and some
C++.

## WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?

Recently I have been watching a lot more college football, and spent a lot
of my summer player NCAA Football. I love good television -- I grew up on Star
Trek: The Next Generation (which subsequently indoctrinated me with a humanist
disposition), and enjoy fantasy, science fiction, and drama. I used to write
a lot of poetry and some short fiction, which I lost the knack for when I
entered college. Recently I am trying to get back into a groove with that.
When I am at home and I am stressed I break out my electric guitar and play
(poorly).

## WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?

This semester, I am taking Artificial Intelligence, Efficient Algorithms and
Intractable Problems, Contemporary Literature, Introductory Chinese, and
Introduction to Short Fiction Writing. Other than that, I am working on some
personal projects I am not yet ready to divulge (mainly because I want to
actually get somewhere with them before I claim them as my idea).
