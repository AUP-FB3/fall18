## WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?

I am a local kid -- I grew up moving around various places throughout
the East Bay and Solano (Hercules, Vallejo, San Pablo, Richmond, and back to
Hercules). I spent many weekends in the shadow of the university. I usually
visited my grandmother at work at Alta Bates Medical Center a few
blocks away from the school. When I got bored I would walk down
Telegraph Ave. and spend my afternoons at Amoeba and Rasputin's looking
for used '90s rock and indie CDs.

I didn't plan to go to Berkeley in high school; it was too close to home, 
but it ended up being my choice.


## HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?

I began with Snap! (I had no programming experience throughout all of 
grade school). Since then, I learned Python, Scheme, Java, C, C++, JavaScript, 
HTML/CSS, some Assembly, and some SQL.

## WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?

I love good television -- I grew up on Star Trek: The Next Generation (subsequently 
indoctrinating me with a humanist disposition). I generally enjoy fantasy, science 
fiction, and drama. I write short stories and creative nonfiction, and am currently
working on a couple of writing projects which I hope to complete by the end of the
summer. I also enjoy reading fiction, nonfiction (political theory in particular), 
and taking part in political activism. Recently I am looking to get immersed in the
SF local music scene (if you have recommendations I'm happy to hear them!) When I'm 
stressed out I break out my electric guitar and play (poorly).

## WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?

Tormenting my students (just kidding...mostly). I am going to be teaching this class, 
interning at PayPal, taking a class on digital education learning envrionments, and
working on a short story or two. I am also currently working on a research proposal 
and trying to figure out what to do now that I graduated (or, in other words, find 
some semblance of direction in life).
