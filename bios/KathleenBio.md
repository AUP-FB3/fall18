## WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?
I grew up in New Jersey, hibernating for half the year in the loving bosom of the electric blanket and lamenting the existence of mosquitos for the rest. When I first visited Cal, it was sunny, it was warm, there were dogs everywhere, and I was so sozzled. So that was that.
