## WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?

I grew up in Chino Hills, a suburb in Southern California about 1 hour east of Los Angeles. I went to International Polytechnic High School (the name is fancy, but the school is not) a small college prep High School on the campus of Cal-Poly Pomona. There I was able to take college classes in High School, which was great because I was done with my breadth requirements by the time I got to Berkeley. I applied to a lot of UCs as I planned to stay in California and ended up getting into CAL!

## HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?

I came into Berkeley intending to major in Linguistics and had no prior programming experience. CS10 was the first class I took here at CAL. I fell in love with the course and Computer Science. I am now a double majoring Linguistics and Computer Science. Last summer I was fortunate enough to land an internship at Amazon working on the Alexa Shopping team where I programmed in Java.

 I have programmed in Snap! (Netsblox), python, java, C and some other languages. My favorite Language is Snap!

## WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?

CS10 

## WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS & SKILLS?

I’m a member of Cal Wushu and have been doing Wushu since I was about 7 years old. However, I haven’t competed since graduating from High School. I also like to dance and am part of [M]ovement a dance organization on campus.

## HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?

In Taiwan a monkey once slapped my leg so hard it gave me a bruise.

## WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?

I am taking CS 164 (Compilers and Programming Languages), Ling 243 (Language, Computation, and Cognition), Ling 109 (Bilingualism), EE16A (Designing Information Devices and Systems), INDENG 195 (Richard Newton Lecture Series), and CS 294-131 (Special Topics in Deep Learning). In February I'll be traveling to Baltimore to attend SIGCSE a conference on computer science education and in March I will be speaking on a panel at the Bay Area Computer Science Fair.
