## WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?

I grew up in Fremont, California (the last stop on Bart)! In high school, I had no idea what I wanted to major in, so I really wanted to go to a well-rounded school that allowed me to explore a bunch of different majors (all 8 of my classes from freshman year were from different departments, so it's safe to say I did my fair share of exploring). Cal seemed to be a great choice for me, plus it's local, which is great!

## HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?

I’d never programmed before coming to Cal, so my first exposure to computer science was actually in CS10, which I took way back in Spring of 2016! Since then, I’ve taken a computer science class every semester, and I’ve programmed in Snap!, Python, Java, and R.

## WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?

I really enjoy reading, dancing, watching TV, and singing (though I’m not very good at it).

## HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?

This past summer, I went skydiving (highly recommend)!

## WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?
My classes (CS189: Machine Learning, Educ 163: Contemporary Issues in US Education, Info 190: Data Mining and Analytics, and Stat 135: Concepts of Statistics), teaching CS10 of course, research, and possibly some casual dance team(?)!
