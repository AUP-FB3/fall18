## WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?

I grew up in Fremont, California (the last stop on Bart)! I knew I wanted to stay local for college, so Cal ended up being a great choice for me.

## HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?

I’d never programmed before coming to Cal, so my first exposure to computer science was actually in CS10! Since then, I’ve taken a computer science class every semester, and I’ve programmed in Snap!, python, Java, and R.

## WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?

I really enjoy learning new things, reading, watching TV, and singing (though I’m not very good at it).

## WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?
My classes (CS170: Algorithms, CS186: Databases, Data100: Principles of Data Science, Ling100: Introduction to Linguistics), teaching CS10, and research! :)
