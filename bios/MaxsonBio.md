## WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?
I am from West Covina, California, but it's easier to say I'm from Los Angeles. I almost didn't apply to Berkeley but I needed a third UC and I didn't want to read about UCSD's various colleges at the time. In high school I played the marimba in my school's percussion ensemble which was a lot of fun. 

## HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?

I started programming second semester of my freshman year when I decided to take this course and I like to work on small projects on the side when I have some free time! I know Snap, Python, Java, Swift, R, and some HTML. My favorite language is Python because it's a lot easier to read and write. Recently though, I've been doing a lot of programming in Swift because I've been learning some mobile development!

## WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?

When I'm hungry, I like to cook because eating is kind of important and it's nice to be able to prepare food for yourself or for others. When I'm feeling productive, I try to do some programming on the side, take online courses, or read on my laptop. If I'm not feeling productive, you can out and about in SF and Oakland, or playing games. If you happen to have Borderlands 2 or Civ V on Steam, feel free to hit me up anytime!

## HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?

My highest WPM is 152.
I helped organize the TEDx conference at my high school.
This one time when I was little, I got lost from my relatives in the mall. I ended up walking to a friend's place two miles away so I could borrow their phone to call my mom.

## WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?
CS70. I'm also working on an app that hopefully I can share with you all in the future!
