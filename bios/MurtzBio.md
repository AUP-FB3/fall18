## WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?
I grew up in a small suburb in the east corner of Anaheim in Southern California (called Anaheim Hills). For those of you who have trouble picturing where this is, my family’s home is about twenty minutes from Disneyland. I always enjoyed academics and made it a huge part of my life, so I always planned to go to a college which could stimulate my love for academia. However, as late as February of my senior year of high school, I had no intention of coming to Berkeley. I just applied to apply, but stressed minimally about being accepted (at least, relative to some of the other places I applied). However, it came down to a choice between Cal and UCLA. UCLA was too close, and Cal impressed me after I researched into it some more. Now I can’t picture myself anywhere else.

## HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE AND IN WHAT LANGUAGES?
I cared very little for technology before coming to Cal (I wanted to be a lawyer). I was academically inclined, but my precollegiate education never included computer science. I was introduced to a blocks-based language during Hour of Code once, thought it was boring and pointless, and never got into it. Then came CS10. The enthusiasm of the course staff rubbed off on me, and since then I’ve programmed in Snap! and Python. I’ll probably learn Java sometime soon.

## WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?
In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball and making conversation with people. You’ll also find me reading articles and watching videos about climate change. Occasionally, I will spend time reflecting on my life and the lives of those close to me, recording what I learn in a “journal” of sorts.

## WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS AND SKILLS?
I pick things up slowly and steadily, but once I do, the concepts stick incredibly well. I genuinely enjoy public speaking, and back on high school Mock Trial was a decent debater (I haven’t debated in a long time, but I could probably refresh my abilities with some practice). Curiously, I sound horrendous when I try to sing in English, but I’ve been told that when I switch to Arabic, I sound all right.

## HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING MEMORABLE? HAS ANYTHING REMARKABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?
I won a sermon recitation competition once, and while it was definitely one of the most memorable things I’ve done, it isn’t the most remarkable thing that I have experienced. That honor must go to when I was doing box jumps, jumped off the box, and lacerated my head on the fenced ceiling. I didn’t feel any pain, and didn’t realize I was injured until I wiped my head and saw my hand covered in blood. There’s a great picture of me smiling after the injury.

## WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SUMMER?
This summer, in addition to being Head LA for CS10, I’ll be working as a Student Assistant at Lawrence Berkeley in the Climate/Ecosystem Sciences Division, helping with research on tropical cyclones. On the side, I’ll be working with a former GSI on her psychology research project. In my free time, I’ll be practicing basketball, learning some Linear Algebra and Discrete Math, and watching Once Upon a Time/Boy Meets World/Girl Meets World.
