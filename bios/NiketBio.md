## WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?
I grew up mostly in the High Desert town of Palmdale, California. I went to Quartz Hill High School, one of the last schools in my valley to offer an IB program. I was almost set on going to UCLA until Cal Day, where I changed my mind after falling in love with the Berkeley campus and marching band.

## HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?
My first time coding was in CS10 with Snap! during my first semester at Cal. Some languages I’ve programmed in are Python, Java, and C, as well as a little HTML and JavaScript doing web development for Cal Band.

## WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?
I love playing music and going to concerts. Some of the shows I’m looking forward to this spring are Tyler the Creator w/ Vince Staples and Fleet Foxes.

## WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS & SKILLS?
I play piano, french horn, mellophone, and am currently learning guitar.

## HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?
My freshman year I had the chance to perform in the Super Bowl 50 halftime show with Coldplay, Beyoncé, and Bruno Mars! I've clung to that that as my go to fun fact ever since.

## WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?
Some cool classes I’m taking this semester are CS 161 (Computer Security), CS 170 (Algorithms), and Music 142 (Wind Ensemble). Other than that I’ll be doing some more coding for Cal Band and looking for internships!
