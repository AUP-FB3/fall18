## WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?

I grew up about an hour south of Cal in San Jose! For some reason, I always thought Berkeley was a super weird place I wouldn't wanna go to. However, I visited a friend here a few times in High School and absolutely fell in love with the campus. Senior Year I got my acceptance letter and the rest is history! 



## HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?

I was super scared of taking a CS class at Berkeley because I had never truly programmed before. After taking CS10, I had the confidence to continue down this path! Along the way, I learned Snap!, Python, Java, and HTML.

## WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?

I love watching sitcoms and analyzing music. And looking at the meme page.

## WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS & SKILLS?

I'm really good at buying presents for people. I also like to cook and bake.

## HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?

I won the Time Person of the Year award in 2006!

## WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?

CS10, CS 61B and 70 (I know, I know), IEOR 162, the Kanye Decal, Dan's research group GamesCrafters, working at Cal Alumni Association and living a happy life :-)
