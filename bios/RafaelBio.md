## WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?

I was born to a Uruguayan dad and a Panamanian mom in Tokyo, Japan. We moved to Ciudad de Panamá, Panamá when I was two, where I was raised until I came to Berkeley. Originally I wanted to be a Chemical Engineering major and because Panamá had no ChemE program I had to look somewhere else and Cal seemed like a great place.

## HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?

I had never done programming before CS 10. I fell in love with it after Dan’s lecture on abstraction and I have pursued to learn a lot. Now I know Python, HTML, CSS, Snap! (ofc), and (the best) Java.

## WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?

Weirdly enough for a CS major, I cannot be in home unless necessary. I am a very outdoorsy person and I especially enjoy Photography and traveling to new and remote places, especially the ones in which I can learn and understand the struggle and problems that the underpriviledged face (especially in Latin America); all of which I plan to fix using computing.

## WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS & SKILLS?

I have a very dark sense of humor which my friends tend to enjoy (sometimes too much) and a capacity to approach strangers and live quite wild experiences due to my outgoingness.

## HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?

Having a family that supports me whenever I need and being able to be born and raised in a very International and Latin American household is something I always feel grateful about.

## WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?

CS 10, CS 70, EECS 16B, IEOR 135 (best course by far I’ve taken at Berkeley), Nutrisci 10, Portuguese 27, Latin American Leadership Society, working on a start-up, and working on my own projects (hopefully).
