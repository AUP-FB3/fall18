## WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?
I grew up in Fairfield, California (just outside of Napa, CA). I went to a very small private school for kindergarten through high school — my graduating class was about 50 students, so coming to cal was a HUGE change of pace for me. I actually had no intention of applying to Cal because I didn’t think I was close to being a competitive applicant, but I applied for fun since the application fee was waived and I was applying to other UC's anyways. A couple months later I got my acceptance letter and now I’m here!

## HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?
Prior to CS10 I had 0 programming experience. Now, I’ve programmed in SNAP!, Python, C, Java, SQL, and a few other less important languages!

## WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?
I really enjoy being outside, hanging out with friends, or going on road trips (I drove all the way to North Carolina from CA a few years back). I’m also really into photography and graphic design — I have a few Snapchat geofilters around campus!

## WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS & SKILLS?
I played the piano for about 14 years in a musical conservatory, but haven’t touched a piano since I graduated high school so I’m a little (lot) rusty. I can also hang a spoon from my nose! 

## HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?
One of my favorite memories happened a few years ago when I was a tour guide at the Jelly Belly Factory when I gave a private tour to a group of Pixar animators who were using Jelly Belly’s production line as inspiration for the design of the mechanisms of the 'memory center’ from Inside Out!

## WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?
This semester I’ll mostly be spending time focusing on my classes (CS186, Econ 119, Cogsci C127), hopefully getting some kind of research position on campus, and looking for jobs/internships. I’m also a member of Innovative Design and Berkeley Innovation (both design-focused clubs on campus)!
