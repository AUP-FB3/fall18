WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?

I was born in Tel Aviv, Israel. My parents and I moved to San 
Jose, CA, when I was about three years old. I grew up in San 
Jose and came to Cal in 2013!

HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?

My first ever experience programming was in CS10. There, I 
learned Snap! and a bit of python, and fell in love with computer 
science. Since then, I switched over to the CS major and have 
taken some more CS courses. For the most part, I’ve worked with
Snap!, python, java, C, and Groovy. I think it’s fun to learn 
new programming languages—in many ways it is not too different 
from learning new spoken languages! Recently I’ve been learning 
a new language called Golang.

WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?

I enjoy yoga and hiking and traveling and camping and dancing 
and cooking and friendship.

WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS & SKILLS?

My first language is Hebrew! I speak Hebrish (an English-Hebrew hybrid) 
at home with my family. I also know a bit of Spanish, as I learned
it for six years in school and have a friend in Spain who I
visit occasionally. 

HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?

I’ve been stung by a jellyfish! Though not my proudest moment… Also, 
I’ve registered for the Berkeley Half Marathon this coming November, 
so hopefully at the end of the semester I’ll be able to say that I 
have ran a 13.1 mile race! [I guess now that it’s on the internet I 
can’t back out, oops]

WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?
Classes, teaching CS10, training for the Berkeley Half Marathon, and 
enjoying my final year at UC Berkeley!
