# Lab Check-Off Questions

<div class="page-section" markdown="1">

## Directions

**All lab check-off deadlines are at 11:59PM.**
(However, you need to get checked off by a TA or lab assistant, so you last chance to get checked off is during lab or office hours.)

To get checked off, you should prepare answers to the specific questions for each lab. You shouldn't feel compelled to memorize every single detail of lab. The goal here to make sure you're on track with CS10 and you should be comfortable with the higher level concepts for each question. For each lab the first questions are the biggest ideas, and the later questions are for your own benefit and review.

**Remember:** Even if you miss a check-off deadline, you can still get 50% credit for any lab check off at any time during the semester.

* Why is the broadcast block useful? Give an example of a good situation to use one.

## Lab 5: Lists 1 {#lab5}

**Required**

## Lab 8: Testing Code and 2048 {#lab8}

**Required**

* How does the **test** block work? What is its domain/range?
* Show us the output of your **test** block on **merge column**. Explain why this output makes sense, and how the test block is checking this block. 
* How will writing tests help you for the 2048 assignment? 
* How do **merge up** and **merge column** work? What are the domain/range of each block? 
* What is the domain and range of the **update display** block? 

**More Self-Check Questions**

* What tests could you have written for HW2 (Encryptify)?
* Explain how each of the HW3 blocks (that you are going to fill in as your  hw assignment) are supposed to work, to your lab partner(s). 

---

# Week 6: Labs 9 and 10

**Required**

* What is an algorithm? 

**More Self-Check Questions**

* Coming soon!

## Lab 9: Concurrency {#lab9}

**Required**

* What is deadlock? What is the race condition?
* Is it always true that splitting a task among 10 “workers” is better than splitting it among 5 “workers”?
* What is the difference between determinism and nondeterminism, in the context of concurrency?
* How does Snap! handle concurrency?
* What happened as you added more people in the card sorting activity?

**More Self-Check Questions**

* What were some strategies your team thought of in the card sorting activity? How do these relate to how a computer handles concurrency?
